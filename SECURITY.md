## Security Best Practices

### For Developers

1. **Keep dependencies updated**
   - Regularly update project dependencies to patch known vulnerabilities
   - Use `npm audit` to check for vulnerable dependencies

2. **Authentication & Authorization**
   - Always use secure authentication methods
   - Implement proper authorization checks
   - Never store sensitive information in client-side code

3. **Data Validation**
   - Validate all input data on both client and server sides
   - Use Zod for runtime validation
   - Sanitize user inputs to prevent injection attacks

4. **API Security**
   - Use HTTPS for all API communications
   - Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse
   - Use proper authentication for API endpoints

5. **Environment Variables**
   - Never commit sensitive environment variables to version control
   - Use `.env.local` for local development
   - Use secure environment variable management in production

### For Users

1. **Account Security**
   - Use strong, unique passwords
   - Enable two-factor authentication if available
   - Log out from shared devices

2. **Data Privacy**
   - Be mindful of what information you share
   - Regularly review your account permissions
