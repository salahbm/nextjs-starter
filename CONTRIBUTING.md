## Development Guidelines

### File Naming

- Use kebab-case for all files and folders.

### Pages (Next.js)

- Pages live under `app/[locale]/...`.
- Page file (`page.tsx`) contains ONLY:
  - SSR logic: metadata, headers, etc.
  - Data fetching
  - Passing data to a view component
- Never put UI code directly inside a page.
- Import and render the view from `components/views/...`.

### View Components

- Each view gets its own folder under `components/views/{view-name}/`.
- Export the main view from `index.tsx`.
- Place subcomponents in `components/views/{view-name}/components/`.

### Types

- For multiple types in a view, create `{view-name}.d.ts` in the same folder.

### Utils (Scoped)

- Place logic/helpers for a view in `components/views/{view-name}/utils/`.

### Shared (Scoped)

- If something is reused multiple times within a view, put it in `shared.ts` or `shared/` folder inside that view folder.

### Project-Wide Shared

- If reusable across the project:
  - Components → `components/shared/{name}/index.tsx`
  - Utils → `utils/{name}/` or `utils/{name}.ts`
  - Styles → `styles/{name}.css`
  - Types → `types/{name}.d.ts`
  - Constants → `constants/{name}.ts`

### Forms

- Use `components/shared/form-fields/index.ts` as a wrapper for all input, select, date pickers, file uploads, etc.
- Never use raw `<input>` directly in views unless unavoidable.

### Typography

- Always use classes from `styles/font.css` (`font-header` … `font-caption-2`).
- Avoid inline font styles unless absolutely unavoidable.
- All headings, labels, captions, and body text must use predefined classes.

### TypeScript

- Never use `any`.
- Use `unknown` if unavoidable.
- Prefer Zod for runtime validation.

### Imports/Exports

- Use absolute imports (`@/components/...`).
- Export from `index.ts` (barrel) for every folder.

### Code Quality

- Small, focused components.
- Strict ESLint/Prettier rules.
- Separate concerns: SSR (pages) vs CSR (views).

### Internationalization

- Use `next-intl` for all translations.
- Supported locales: `en` (default) and `ru`.
- Always create translation files in `messages/{namespace}.json`.
- Use descriptive keys with dot-notation.
